-> probability: a way to measure how likely something to happen
    probability = favarouble outcome / total outcome
    eg:- coin toss[head,tail]
        probability of head is 1/2
    die roll[1,2,3,4,5,6]
        probability of 2 is 1/6
    word list[d,d,d,t,t]
        probability of d is 3/5

-> conditional probability: occurance of two events and one event has already taken place
    eg:- [Dt,Dc,De,Tt,Tc]
    p(A) -> probability of D = 3/5
        p(B/A) -> probability of t from p(A) = 1/3
    p(B) -> probability of t = 2/5
        p(A/B) -> probability of D from p(B) = 1/2

p(A/B) = ( p(B/A) * p(A) ) / p(B)
p(B/A) = ( p(A/B) * p(B) ) / p(A)
