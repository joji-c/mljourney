we use % sign to do terminal commands in jupyter notes
in reading a csv file if data seperated by   ;  instead of  ,  then we use delimiter=";"  within read_csv
we use pyplot from matplotlib ,it has methods loke plot and show for making graphs 
we add a point or any symbol at the data point of the graph using marker="symbols" in plot method ("." , "," , "^" , "o")
to change line style using linestyle="" in plot method (dashed,dotted,dashdot,none,default="solid")
to change line color we use color="" in plot method ("green","blue","or the colors hexadecimal value",etc any color)
to change the lines thickness we use linewidth=1,2,3... in plot method
we add title using plt.title("title_name") and use color,size and weight to edit the title
we use shadow = true/false to have a grapgh shadow effect or not
we use autopct=%1.1f%%  to get percentage in pie chart
we can add a label="label_name" in pie chart and show it by using plt.legend()
histogram is used to group ranges

line chart    -> plt.plot(variable)
bar chart     -> plt.bar(variable.index,variable.values)
pie chart     -> plt.pie(variable,labels=variable.index)
scatter chart -> plt.scatter(variable.index,variable.values)
histogram     -> plt.hist(variable,bin=(any num),edgecolor=(any color))

virtual env has all the extensions required to run a certain program
insatll virtal env             -> pip install virtalenv
creating a virtaul enviornment -> python -m virtualenv env_name     #end the name with 'env' to understand its a virtual env and -m means that it runs as a module
to run or activate said env    -> env_name\scripts\activate
or change from global env
now install all the packages needed for this program into this env 
to exit from virtual env       -> deactivate or close terminal
to send this env to someone    -> pip freeze >requirements.txt

we use line chart to see progress
we use bar,pie in catogarical data  
for distributional data we use histogram 
when we have numbers in both axises we use scatter graph to find its correlation
when we compare we use boxplot

correlation  -> df[[column1,column2,column3....]].corr()
it show if one column increases the other increases if + corr or decreases if - corr
