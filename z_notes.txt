data cleaning (fixing null values, changing date to hr and min etc)
eda -> exploratory data analysis (findings found from cleaned sata)
featureEngineering -> up/down sampling,smote,label encoding for ml

how to check duplicates       -> df[df["column_name"].duplicates].shape
how to remove duplicates      -> df=df.drop_duplicates(subset=["column],keep="first")
to save cleaned data          -> df.to_csv("new_empty_file_path")

machine learning :- a branch of ai, where computer learn from data and make prediction or decision with out being explicitly
programmed for every case
in ml we give both input and output of that input to traint he ml to leran and predict 

steps involved in ml:
-> data observe
-> data collect
-> data cleaned
-> data analyse(eda)
-> feature engineering decide independant and dependant variable
-> split data into training data 80% and testing data 20%
-> select model training algorithm
-> train the model
-> evaluate the model
