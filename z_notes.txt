data cleaning (fixing null values, changing date to hr and min etc)
eda -> exploratory data analysis (findings found from cleaned sata)
featureEngineering -> up/down sampling,smote,label encoding for ml

how to check duplicates       -> df[df["column_name"].duplicates].shape
how to remove duplicates      -> df=df.drop_duplicates(subset=["column],keep="first")
to save cleaned data          -> df.to_csv("new_empty_file_path")

machine learning :- a branch of ai, where computer learn from data and make prediction or decision with out being explicitly
programmed for every case
in ml we give both input and output of that input to traint he ml to leran and predict 

steps involved in ml:
-> data observe
-> data collect
-> data cleaned
-> data analyse(eda)
-> feature engineering decide independant(input or x) and dependant(output or y) variable and feature scaling
-> split data into training data 80% and testing data 20%
-> select ml algorithm
-> train the model
-> evaluate the model

types of machine learning:
-> supervised machine learning :- used when there are independant(input) and dependant(output) variable
    -> classification :- output is a class 
        ->KNN,naivebayes,sym,decisiontree,randomforest
    -> regression :- output is numerical

-> unsupervised machine learning :- used when we have independant(input) and groups/cluster(output)

we use scikit-learn library to scale data and many other ml functions

-> to scale all independant values
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler/StandardScaler     -> this is how we import it
and we should create an object for the class MinMaxScaler
then    ->  scaler=MinMaxScaler()
            xscaled=scaler.fit_transform(x)
            xscaled

->to train and test model
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split       ->this is how we import it
X_train,X_test,Y_train,Y_test=train_test_split(Xscaled,Y,test_size=0.2)
